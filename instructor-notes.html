      ##Instructor Notes

      ##Ladies Learning Code: jQuery for Beginners

      <br>
      #Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong>Getting Started (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>: Intro, Programming fundamentals part 1, JavaScript vs. jQuery, the console
      * <strong>Variables (11:00 am - 12:30 pm)</strong>: Variables, concatenation, numbers and operators, class exercise, objects
      * <strong>Functions (12:30 pm - 1:30 pm)</strong> Functions and arguments, jQuery examples, using Atom, including jQuery
      * <strong> (1:30 pm -2:00 pm)</strong>: HTML overview, CSS overview, selectors, click events
      * <strong>Class Exercise (2:00 pm - 2:30 pm)</strong>: Continuing click events, chain events, <code>$(this)</code>, active menu exercise
      * <strong>More class exercises (2:30 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>:
      Personalizing the page, jQuery plugins, Flexslider
      * <strong>Customizations (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>: Slider configuration, smooth scroll, next steps & resources

      <br>
      #General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files from slide 1 and create an account with wordpress.com - check in as people are entering the room and encourage them to ask yourself or a mentor for help with set-up!
      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.

      * Show learners how to open files. Go through the steps - e.g. Open Atom > File > add project folder. Do it slowly or show them twice if necessary.
      * Show learners how to copy text from slides + paste into atom. Keyboard shortcuts can be new to some learners: Remember to mention them especially since they're invisible to them when you use keyboard shortcuts on the overhead projector. PLEASE mention both Windows & Mac shortcuts, not just 1 or the other!
      * Remind learners to constantly SAVE + REFRESH (and show them how). Encourage them to make small changes at a time, save, and refresh. Show them how to Undo from shortcuts or the edit menu.
      * Share shortcuts and tips on navigating between windows. Hot corners, shortcut keys, taskbar hovers. Whatever works.

      #Specific Examples

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <strong>Slide 4: Today's project</strong><br />
      It's important to walk them through the example website so they can get a visual of what they will be working towards

      <strong>Slide 7: HTML + CSS + JavaScript</strong><br />
      Analogy: HTML is like the foundation of a house. It is the walls, the roof, and the floor.
      The CSS is the configuration as well as the stylistic elements. How large is each room? How tall is the ceiling? Where are the doors positioned? As well as the stylistic elements like the paint and the flooring.
      The JavaScript is the plumbing, the heating and air conditioning, and the alarm system.

      <strong>Slide 9: What Is JavaScript?</strong><br />
      We now have the ability to animate things with CSS3 properties.
      You can also hide and show elements with CSS based on some user action (eg. <code>:hover</code>)

      <strong>Slide 11: What is jQuery?</strong><br />
      It's important to emphasize that all jQuery is is a very long JavaScript file that a group of people wrote together (and are continuing to write and improve) to make our lives as developers easier. What we used to have to write with a lot of JavaScript we can write with a little bit of jQuery. Try to enstil an appreciation for the folks that built jQuery that allow us to code more efficiently.

      <strong>Slide 17: Variables & Functions</strong><br />
      These are actually the building blocks of all Object Oriented programming languages. If you have experience with any others, you can mention them now. Mention that these fundamentals are not unique to JavaScript and can help them better understand many other programming languages they may encounter in the future.

      <strong>Slide 18: What is a variable?</strong><br />
      You can describe this like a ziploc container with a tape label on the lid. The tape reads "lasagna", which describes the contents of the container. If one day you eat the lasagna, and then put some other food in the container and don't update the tape label on the lid, you may mislead your children when they are rummaging through the fridge in a morning frenzy looking for their lunch. So the label (name) should always accurately describe the contents (value).

      <strong>Slide 19: Declaring (creating) a variable</strong><br />
      You can show what we mean by "Evaluate everything to the right of the equals sign" while you're on this slide. Eg. <code>var subtotal = 24 + 32</code>

      <strong>Slide 23: Variable Types: Strings & Concatenation</strong><br />
      Concatenation is like stringing beads onto a bracelet.<br />
      To determine the "greeting time" in this example, maybe we have another variable that stores the current time. Then we can create an if condition: if the time is between 0:00 and 12:00, the value of <code>greeting</code> will be "morning". If the time is between 13:00 and 17:00, the value will be "afternoon"

      <strong>Slide 25: Class exercise: Using Variables</strong><br />
      Imagine declaring a variable like having a conversation with your browser.
      You: "Hey Browser, can you remember my birthday is on Jan 26?"
      Browser: "kay"
      You: "Hey Browser, when's my birthday?"
      Browser: "Jan 26"

      <strong>Slide 36: Variable Types: Booleans</strong><br />
      Eg., a variable to check if the user's credit card is expired, or if they are older than 16 years old to create a Facebook account without parental consent

      <strong>Slide 40: Add the Properties to the Object</strong><br />
      Like writing a sentence that lists things, you do not need a comma after the last item on the list.

      <strong>Slide 46: Functions</strong><br />
      Imagine programming a robot and creating a function to sweep the floor. The function would include how to hold the broom, what type of motion is required by your arms and feet, and then how to use a dustpan. Now that you have written that set of instructions, you will never have to teach the robot again how to sweep the floor. When you tell the robot <code>sweepFloor()</code>, it will access those instructions and execute them exactly.

      <strong>Slide 59: Setting up your project files</strong><br />
      Please take the time to follow through the instructions on this slide slowly so everyone can follow along. File > Open is more habitual to most of us then adding a project folder, so this tends to cause some confusion.

      <strong>Slide 71: CSS overview</strong><br />
      Note that in this image the CSS is written all on one line. Browsers do not care about spacing, indentation and line breaks. It can read all of our code just fine in one line, but humans can't as well. We add space and indent our code to make it easier for us to scan and manage.

      <strong>Slide 84: CSS overview</strong><br />
      Breaking up a problem into small steps is a skill you develop as a programmer. Don't try to do too many things at once or it'll be harder to debug where you went wrong.

      <strong>Slide 100: jQuery Plugins</strong><br />
      A website is like a hiker with a backpack. Every plugin you have on your site is like adding more weight to your backpack, which causes you to travel slower. You must pack smart and only carry the items you know you  will use.

      <strong>Slide 103: Class Exercise</strong><br />
      You need your paint brushes before you can paint!

      <strong>Slide 105: Add Flexslider HTML</strong><br />
      Click on the documentation link and walk them through the instructions on that page. A huge part of being a developer is reading and following documentation, so walking through this process with them can help them feel more confident to do so on their own in the future.

      <strong>Slide 107: It works! Sort of...</strong><br />
      Resize the browser window so they can see the responsiveness in action. You can even show them the device mode in Chrome's Developer Tools if you have time.

      <strong>Slide 108: Where are the arrows?</strong><br />
      We use different font formats (.eot, .ttf, .woff) so that our fonts work across all browsers.
